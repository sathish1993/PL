<p>
This handout documents what you need to do to set up your computer
environments for this course.
</p>
<h2>Setting Up Your Account on the CS Linux Machines</h2>
<p>
All students registered for this course should have been given an account on
<tt>remote.cs.binghamton.edu</tt> and should have been sent an email with their
access information if the account was not already active.
</p>
<p>
It is required that all submitted programming projects work under the
environment available on <tt>remote</tt>.
</p>
<p>
It is best that you set things up so that your account environment is
setup automatically for the course.  Unfortunately, the method of
doing so depends on the kind of login shell you are using as different
shells use slightly different syntaxes.  Usually, you can determine
which kind of shell you are using, based on the prompt you receive
after you login: if the prompt contains a <tt>$</tt> character, you are
probably using a <tt>sh</tt>-based shell; if the prompt contains a <tt>%</tt>
character, you are probably using a <tt>csh</tt>-based shell.  One way to be
sure which shell you are using is by looking at the output of the
command <tt>ps -p $$</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Use your favorite editor to make the below changes in your shell startup
files (if you do not have a favorite editor, the end of this document
contains instructions specific to <tt>emacs</tt>).
</p>
<p>
If using a <tt>csh</tt>-type shell, then add the following line to your login
startup file (usually <tt>~/.login</tt>):
</p>
<pre>
        source ~umrigar/cs571-16f/bin/student.login
</pre>
<p>
and the following line to the startup file run by your shell when started as
a non-login shell (usually, <tt>~/.tcshrc</tt> or <tt>~/.cshrc</tt>):
</p>
<pre>
        source ~umrigar/cs571-16f/bin/student.cshrc
</pre>
<p>
If you are using a <tt>sh</tt>-based shell, you need to add the following line to
your login startup file (one of <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt>, <tt>~/.bash_login</tt>, or
<tt>~/.profile</tt> if using <tt>bash</tt>)
</p>
<pre>
        . ~umrigar/cs571-16f/bin/student.profile
</pre>
<p>
and the following line to the startup file run by your shell when started as
a non-login shell (<tt>~/.bashrc</tt> if using <tt>bash</tt>):
</p>
<pre>
        . ~umrigar/cs571-16f/bin/student.rc
</pre>
<p>
Note the leading period in both cases.
</p>
<p>
When you login <b>after</b> adding the above lines, you should see a <b>read-only</b>
copy of the <tt>cs571-16f</tt> course directory in your home directory (this is
merely a symbolic link to the master course directory).  This directory
contains all the course material and mirrors the course web site.
</p>
<p>
You are free to ignore these instructions if you know what you are doing.  A
typical situation when you may want to ignore these instructions is when you
are using the same account for other courses and the environment setup by
these instructions interferes with the environment needed for the other
courses.
</p>
<h2>The Organization of the <tt>cs571-16f</tt> Subdirectory</h2>
<p>
Typically, the <tt>cs571-16f</tt> directory will contain the following
subdirectories:
</p>
<dl>
<p><dt><tt>bin</tt><dd>
    Shell scripts, etc.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="../../docs/">docs</a><dd>
    Documentation.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="../../exams-quizzes/">exams</a><dd>
    Exams and solutions.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="../../hws/">hws</a><dd>
    Homeworks and solutions.
</p>
<p><dt><tt>include</tt><dd>
    If present, it will contain header files for libraries specific
    to this course.
</p>
<p><dt><tt>interludes</tt><dd>
    If present, this directory will contain interesting material
    marginally relevant or totally irrelevant to this course.
</p>
<p><dt><tt>lib</tt><dd>
    If present, it will contain libraries specifically installed
    for this course.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="../../misc/">misc</a><dd>
    Miscellaneous information (including files like this)
</p>
<p><dt><a href="../../programs/">programs</a><dd>
    Programs discussed during class.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="../../projects/">projects</a><dd>
     Programming projects and solutions.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="../../slides">slides</a><dd>
     Source, hardcopy and html versions of classroom transparencies.
</p>
<p><dt><tt>src</tt><dd>
     If present, this directory will contain source code for tools and
     libraries specifically installed for this course.
</p>
</dl>
<p>
Most of the above directory structure is available via the course home
page at <a href="http://zdu.binghamton.edu/cs571-16f">http://zdu.binghamton.edu/cs571-16f</a>. The site is also mirror'd
at <a href="http://cs.binghamton.edu/~umrigar/cs571-16f/">http://cs.binghamton.edu/~umrigar/cs571-16f/</a>.  Most of the
subdirectories are currently empty, but will have material added as
the course progresses.
</p>
<h2>Tracking Changes</h2>
<p>
Assuming you have setup your account as outlined above, each time you
subsequently login to your account, you should be given a list of
<i>interesting</i> source files which have changed since your last login.
</p>
<p>
Note also that the course site is updated via a shared git repository
which can be accessed using ssh at the URL:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  <tt>ssh://</tt><i>user</i><tt>@remote.cs.binghamton.edu/~umrigar/cs571-16f.git</tt>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
where <i>user</i> is your login-id on <tt>remote</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, assuming you have a ssh client and git on your local
machine, you can clone the above repository using <tt>git clone</tt> <i>url</i>
<i>dir</i>, where <i>url</i> is the above URL and <i>dir</i> is the directory into
which you want to clone the repository.
</p>
<p>
You can then track changes within <i>dir</i> using the <tt>git pull</tt> command.
</p>
<p>
[Note: if you have set up your remote.cs account as outlined above,
you will have already have a read-only copy of the <tt>cs571-16f</tt>
directory in your home directory.]
</p>
<p>
To see what changes have been made, use the <tt>git log -</tt><i>N</i> command in
the <tt>cs571-16f</tt> directory to see the last <i>N</i> log messages; to see the
last <i>N</i> log messages for <i>FILE</i> use <tt>git log -</tt><i>N</i> <i>FILE</i>; the log
messages will include a 40 character hex hash specifying the revision.
To see what has changed between two specific revisions use <tt>git diff
-w -r </tt><i>HHHHH</i> <tt>-r</tt> <i>XXXXX</i> <i>FILE</i> where <i>HHHHH</i> and <i>XXXXX</i> are the
first characters of the revisions you want to diff and <i>FILE</i> should
specify the source file (usually <tt>.umt</tt>).
</p>
<h2>Local Development</h2>
<p>
We will be using open-source tools for this course and you are free to
install them on your local machine.  If your local machine is
sufficiently powerful with at least 3 GB of free disk space, 2 GB
of free RAM and a recent x86-64 CPU which supports virtualization
(VT-x/AMD-V), then you can run a environment on your local machine
similar to that available on <tt>remote</tt> by running a vagrant-generated
virtualbox VM on it.
</p>
<p>
To facilitate this, a <a href="./Vagrantfile">Vagrantfile</a> is provided which
can be used to set up a debian 7.11 x86-64 virtual machine containing
most of the tools needed for this course.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, you will need recent versions of both vagrant and virtualbox
installed on your local machine.  It is suggested that you install the latest
version of vagrant from the vagrant <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">site</a>.
</p>
<p>
Copy the <a href="./Vagrantfile">Vagrantfile</a> into an empty directory and
within that directory run the command <tt>vagrant up</tt>.  This should
download all necessary packages and create the virtual machine (it
should take under 1 hour on a typical home internet connection).
</p>
<p>
You can login to your virtual machine using login-id <tt>vagrant</tt> with
password <tt>vagrant</tt>.  Use the right control key if you loose your
mouse.  Once logged in, you can start up a windowing environment using
the command <tt>startxfce4</tt> (you are free to customize the machine and
windowing environment as you wish).  It is probably a good idea to
immediately change the <tt>vagrant</tt> password.  Note that the <tt>vagrant</tt>
user has super-user access (using <tt>sudo</tt>); it may be a good idea to
setup a unprivileged user for regular work.
</p>
<p>
You can run a full-screen X11 environment using the command
<tt>startxfce4</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The use of vagrant is not supported; if you have problems, you
are expected to debug them by yourself.
</p>
<p>
<b>It is still your responsibility to ensure that all submitted
programming projects work on remote.cs</b>.
</p>
<h2>Instructions for Those Unfamiliar with a Unix Environment</h2>
<p>
If you do not already have a favorite editor for Unix systems, then <tt>emacs</tt>
is strongly recommended, as it is much more than a editor and provides all
the functions of a IDE.  The instructions below refer to emacs.
</p>
<p>
In what follows, notation like <tt>C-x</tt> refers to holding
down the control and <tt>x</tt> keys simultaneously, while <tt>ESC x</tt> refers to
hitting the <tt>ESC</tt> key followed by the <tt>x</tt> key.
</p>
<p>
<b>If emacs does not appear to be working properly, the most likely cause is
that your terminal is configured incorrectly</b>.  Usually, you will be using a
terminal emulator which will be emulating something like a <tt>vt100</tt> terminal.
In that case, you would need to set the environmental variable <tt>TERM</tt> to
<tt>vt100</tt>.  Once again, the syntax depends on the shell family being used: use
<tt>TERM=vt100; export TERM</tt> for <tt>sh</tt>-based shells and <tt>setenv TERM vt100</tt> for
<tt>csh</tt>-based shells.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remember that almost all emacs commands can be aborted using</b> <tt>C-g</tt>.
</p>
<h5>Setting Up Your Account</h5>
<p>
Setting up your account typically involves adding a line to a couple
of startup files.  The following assumes that you are using <tt>tcsh</tt> as
your shell and gives detailed instructions for adding a line to your
<tt>~/.login</tt> file which is executed each time you login (vary the
instructions according to your specific requirements; specifically,
the added content will change if you are using a sh-based shell):
</p>
<ol type="1">
<p><li>
While in your home directory, type <tt>emacs .login</tt> to the Unix
      prompt.  Emacs will be entered and will display the contents of the
      file.
</p>
<p><li>
Next use the cursor control down-arrow (or <tt>C-n</tt>) to move to the
      end of the file.
</p>
<p><li>
Insert the following line:
<pre>
        source ~umrigar/cs571-16f/bin/student.login
</pre>
<p>
      <b>You must terminate this line using a newline</b> --- i.e. you should get
      the cursor onto the next line.
</p>
</p>
<p><li>
Run the <tt>save-buffer</tt> command by using <tt>C-x C-s</tt>, and then exit emacs by
      using the <tt>C-x C-c</tt> (<tt>save-buffers-kill-emacs</tt>) command.
</p>
</ol>
<p>
Next time you log in, a read-only directory called <tt>cs571-16f</tt> should appear in
your home-directory.  This directory will contain all the files you need for
this course.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to learn emacs further, you can run the emacs tutorial
by typing <tt>C-h t</tt> while inside emacs.  You can read the online emacs
manual by typing <tt>C-h i</tt>.
