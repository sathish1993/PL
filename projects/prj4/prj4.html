<b>Due Date</b>: 11/23 by 11:59p

<b>Important Reminder</b>: As per the course Academic Honesty Statement,
cheating of any kind will minimally result in receiving an F letter
grade for the entire course.

<h2>Aims of This Project</h2>
<p>
The aims of this project are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
To give you an introduction to programming in Prolog.
</p>
<p><li>
To expose you to using pattern matching for both constructing
    and accessing data-structures.
</p>
<p><li>
To familiarize you with using backtracking in Prolog.
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Project Specification</h2>
<p>
You are required to submit a <tt>prj4.tar.gz</tt> archive which contains a
file <tt>prj4-sol.pl</tt> which can be run using the <tt>swipl</tt> implementation of
Prolog on <tt>remote.cs</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The file should implement the functions specified in the skeleton <a href="./files/prj4-sol.pl">file</a> provided.  Your solutions may include
auxiliary top-level procedures unless explicitly forbidden.
</p>
<h2>Provided Files</h2>
<p>
The <a href="./files">./files</a> directory contains the following:
</p>
<dl>
<p><dt><a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile</a><dd>
    This file contains a <tt>submit</tt> target such that typing <tt>make
    submit</tt> will create a <tt>prj4.tar.gz</tt> archive containing the files
    to be submitted. The <tt>clean</tt> target will remove the archive.
</p>
<p>
    You may edit this file if you choose to use a different
    organization for your project.  When editing, watch out for tabs
    (the first character of any command-line <b>must be a tab
    character</b>).
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/README">README</a><dd>
    A template README; replace the <tt>XXX</tt> with your name, B-number and
    email.  You may add any other information you believe is relevant
    to your project submission.  In particular, you should document
    the data-structure used for your word-store.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/prj4-sol.pl">prj4-sol.pl</a><dd>
    A skeleton file for the exercises.
</p>
</dl>
<h2>Hints</h2>
<p>
You may choose to follow the following hints (they are not by any
means required).  They assume that you are using the project structure
supported by the provided <a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile,</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
First work on your solutions using Prolog's declarative semantics.
    Write facts and rules for a problem which states something
    about the problem domain.
<p>
    Then think about the procedural semantics.  It may be a good
    idea to include facts/rules corresponding to base cases
    before facts/rules corresponding to recursive cases (this
    should not affect correctness, but may result in different
    orders of solutions or a solution versus an infinite loop).
</p>
</p>
<p><li>
The swipl version on <tt>remote.cs</tt> is quite old.  In particular,
    the representations of Prolog strings (required for Exercise 5)
    has changed in newer versions.
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>
You will need to submit a compressed archive file <tt>prj4.tar.gz</tt> which
contains all the files necessary to build your jar file.
Additionally, this archive <b>must</b> contain a <tt>README</tt> file which should
minimally contain your name, B-number, email, the status of your
project and any other information you believe is relevant.
</p>
<p>
If you are using the suggested project structure, then the provided
<a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile</a> provides a <tt>submit</tt> target which will
build the compressed archive for you; simply type <tt>make submit</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Note that it is your responsibility to ensure that your submission is
complete.  To test whether your archive is complete, simply unpack it
into a empty directory and see if it runs correctly.
</p>
<p>
To submit the above archive, please use blackboard by following the
<tt>Content-&gt;Projects</tt> link.
